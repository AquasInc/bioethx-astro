## Support Tools

Support tools assist consultants in the management of consult information. List and Search functions facilitate concise display of only those consults authorized to be accessed by any particular user.

Of particular importance is the ability to upload documents to the server in common electronic formats (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel and image files) for later reference during the consult process. Uploaded documents may take the form of Attachments, specific to an individual consult, which may include legal documents such as advance directives. Uploaded documents may also be stored as Resources, which reside in a private repository for reference by all consultants within a facility. These might be published reference materials or internal organizational documents that describe policies or procedures.

Consultants may utilize a tool for generation of a comprehensive ethics consult note for inclusion into a patient's medical record. Notes are generated as Microsoft Word documents.
