## Evaluation

The workflow includes a final step, once an active consult is closed, during which an assigned evaluator reviews the consult record and optionally interacts with stakeholders in the consult to ensure quality control, staff accountability and identification of opportunities for improvement.

The system offers a contact log to track outreach activity while attempting to connect with a stakeholder. Once contact is made, an evaluation form is presented to guide the evaluator through the interview process and capture key information. Evaluation results are then also stored with the consult record.
