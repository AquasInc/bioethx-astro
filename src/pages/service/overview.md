## Overview

BioEthx™ has conducted research into private sector practices in
documenting and managing the progression of bioethics cases in
the clinical setting. BioEthx staff has long been involved in
the development of software designed to assist ethicists and
ethics committees in managing clinical and organizational ethics
cases. Accumulated expertise and evolving software delivery
methods have now come together to produce the first
publicly-available software system dedicated to the task of
healthcare ethics consult.

The end result is the BioEthx online service for consult
management. The web-based service is designed to support the
management of ethics consults from initial event and
information capture through resolution and follow-up evaluation.
It provides an effective and easy-to-use tool for managing the
workflow of ethics consults in accordance with established
procedures and to fully document case history and the analytical
process undertaken to produce the best possible outcome.

## Features

The BioEthx™ consult management service provides a centralized
repository for recording all of the important information
related to an ethics consult request and the complete
process carried out to achieve the most appropriate outcome.

With minimal training, hospital and clinic staff can create a
record of an expressed concern or a request for action.
Thereafter, the system becomes a valuable tool to guide the
workflow required to properly handle the issue, supporting the
inclusion of additional specialists and promoting collaboration
among consult team members to work towards an optimal
outcome.

BioEthx is a complete tool that helps healthcare organizations
to ensure that appropriate ethics protocols needed to provide
quality healthcare and mitigate risks are applied to both
clinical and organizational ethics cases.
