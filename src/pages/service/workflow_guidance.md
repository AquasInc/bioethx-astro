## Workflow Guidance

Clinical Consultations that involve provision of care to a specific patient are typically the most challenging because they involve multiple internal and external stakeholders, requirements for short-term decision making regarding patient care, and sometimes-difficult moral deliberations that lead to greater complexity.

The clinical consultation in BioEthx is presented as a flexible, multi-step workflow process designed to foster efficiency, accuracy and completeness in reaching the best possible outcome for patients. Through the presentation of screen-to-screen navigation options, the system suggests a workflow process for the orderly execution of activities that typically lead to well-managed ethics consults. There is also significant flexibility in the system to navigate among the steps of the ethics consultation process in a more ad-hoc fashion to support real-time and/or collaborative input and participation by multiple participants and, for more experienced consultants, a streamlined process is available to support efficient provision of core, required information more efficiently.

The system supports a separate workflow process for organizational consultations; those less complex ethics-related situations that involve systemic issues rather than specific patient care. The system ensures that a required minimum level of input is provided before a consultation can be closed to ensure documentation completeness.
