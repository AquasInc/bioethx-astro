## Collaboration

The system maintains a roster of all individuals that are qualified and eligible to become involved in ethics consultations. An Administrator or Consultant can create a new consultation and, as appropriate, choose one or more individuals from the roster for inclusion on the consultation team. This shared access to a common repository of consult details can streamline communications among consult team members and allow the inclusion of consultants that may be at a remote location. The system supports the issuance of notifications via email to ensure timely response and coordination of consult management by advising consultants of referrals, reminders and planned activities.
