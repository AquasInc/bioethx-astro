## Classification

The system creates a repository of information on how specific cases were handled and allows for the classification of cases based on categories of consult focus and more detailed topics within each category. This provides a convenient mechanism for retrospective identification of past consults that may serve to inform current activities and help to improve ethics education and policy setting.
