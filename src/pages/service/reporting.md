## Reporting

Report setup features support the selection of three report options: date range, record type and report type. Date range selection allows filtering of records based on dates of consult requests and the calendar year quarter(s) for which records should be shown. Record type selection is based upon the type of consult (clinical, organizational or both) and the current status of consults (open, closed, pending evaluation, evaluated, no evaluation response, or all).

Report type selection offers options for Standard Report, Process Report, or Evaluation Report, each of which presents a pre-determined combination of content. A user may also choose the Custom Report option, which displays all possible content fields with check boxes to allow selection of any number of report fields.
