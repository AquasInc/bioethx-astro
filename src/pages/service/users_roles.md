## Users and Roles

Each organization (hospital, healthcare system, clinic, etc.) is set up as a unique Facility which contains only the consult information relevant to that organization. Ethics consultants and other system users are assigned specific roles within the system depending on their area of functional responsibility; ethics consult, consult evaluation or system administration. Roles provide for various levels of information visibility and access to system functions. Privileges and navigational authorizations are assigned to user sessions based on their specification of a facility ID and functional role at system login.
